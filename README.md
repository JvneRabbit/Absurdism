# Absurdism
Absurdism is a Doom mod project to make the most absurd Doom mod.


Hi, and welcome to this silly "to do" file that probably only my eyes will see, derp!

𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙞𝙨 𝘼𝙗𝙨𝙪𝙧𝙙𝙞𝙨𝙢?

Absurdism is a (GZ)Doom mod that aims to be a personal project of mine, to develop my coding skills, 
potentially spriting skills and even a fun journey to learn more about the engine and it's quirks.

The name "Absurdism" comes from the very same word, as this project aims to be as absurd, over-the-top, stupid and senseless as possible, adding to it many dumb aspects, ideas and whatnot to make this project a complete shitpost mod.

Yeah, it's basically shitpost, if things go well, it'll be my favorite kind of shitpost, one that takes effort in order to be funny.

This mod is a rework of another mod I spent quite some time working on that unfortunately didn't
and won't saw the light of the day, mostly due to the loss of inspiration and being pretty worn out
by the time I tried to come back to it, it was also pretty janky and my own coding was if anything, hard to understand and get behind, making it harder to actually continue working on it.

That alone was pretty demotivating to continue working it, always saw potential on it but if I wanted it to be something, I would need to just redo everything from scratch and that's what i'll be doing.

Absurdism aims to not only be a fun, enjoyable and stupid mod, but also be an improvement over my past works, making use of my own coding, ideas and everything, trying to make use of other's resources as little as possible.

Inevitably, I'll get stuck on some parts while trying to make this become a reality so making use of other's resources such as scripting and whatnot will be needed, but I will aim to credit everyone and everything as I continue to work onto this.

This is obviously a pretty difficult thing to answer since I don't even know myself, this project's lifespan could be from a couple of months to just a single week, it depends on how much effort I wanna spend on this project while also juggling everything else in my life as well.

Setting up a deadline will be scary, but if it helps, so be it.

As of today, 02 / 11 / 2024, Absurdism has become an idea that I will begin working on and the deadline I'll set up to myself to "complete" this mod will be a month.

I will have until December 2 to make this project a reality. 

God have mercy on me.

I aim that by the time the deadline is met, this mod will offer the most basic of things you'll expect in a 2020 Doom mod.

Must have:

• An over the top gore system that works as best as possible, without straight up copying Brutal Doom.

• New enemies that are all about shitpost and jokes. Current memes and even older memes.

• A functional spent casing system with smoke and the works to make it as fancy as possible.

• Cool weapons!!!

• Bosses. Similar to my older mod, it had different type of strong and tanky enemies that worked in a similar fashion to bosses, they however were poorly coded and not the most fanciest looking, let's make it even better.

• (Optional) Maps, although severely optional, so this won't be my main focus past a functional dev testing map.

• Obviously make a fancy graphic for the mod.

• And of course, have fun while working on this project!

That's pretty much it, get to work now dummy.
